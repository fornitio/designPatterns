Probabilistic paradigms involve using probabilities or likelihoods to make decisions or predictions.

const coinFlip = () => {
  const flip = Math.random();
  if (flip < 0.5) {
    return 'heads';
  } else {
    return 'tails';
  }
};

console.log(coinFlip());  // Output: 'heads' or 'tails'
/*
In this example, the coinFlip function generates a random number between 0 and 1 using the Math.random() function. If the number is less than 0.5, the function returns 'heads', and if it is greater than or equal to 0.5, the function returns 'tails'. This simulates the probability of flipping a coin and landing on either heads or tails.

Probabilistic paradigms are commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence to make predictions or decisions based on the likelihood or probability of certain events occurring. They can be particularly useful in situations where there is uncertainty or incomplete information.
